It is not in Rhaenyra's
nature to be deceitful.

545
00:52:07,157 --> 00:52:08,776
I cannot say the same
for your brother.

546
00:52:10,118 --> 00:52:11,593
You believe he lied?

547
00:52:12,746 --> 00:52:15,055
How often does he
speak the pure truth?

548
00:52:16,041 --> 00:52:19,226
How does confessing
to such things serve him?

549
00:52:22,172 --> 00:52:25,315
By reducing you.

550
00:52:27,302 --> 00:52:29,028
(King Viserys sighs)

551
00:52:30,055 --> 00:52:34,535
Whatever transpired,
Rhaenyra is not innocent.

552
00:52:34,559 --> 00:52:37,163
Only because Daemon
tried to corrupt her.

553
00:52:37,187 --> 00:52:40,416
Daemon and Rhaenyra
share the blood of the dragon.

554
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:42,209
They are restless and chaotic.

555
00:52:42,233 --> 00:52:44,293
She swore to me that
she remains a maiden.

556
00:52:45,904 --> 00:52:48,338
And I believe her.

00:52:49,199 --> 00:52:50,340
♪ ♪

558
00:53:17,018 --> 00:53:20,162
(sighs)

559
00:53:52,595 --> 00:53:54,115
King Viserys:
That dagger

560
00:53:54,139 --> 00:53:55,678
once belonged
to Aegon the Conqueror.

561
00:53:57,851 --> 00:53:59,827
It was Aenar's before that.

562
00:54:00,687 --> 00:54:02,957
And before that...

563
00:54:02,981 --> 00:54:05,207
well, it is difficult to know.

564
00:54:10,697 --> 00:54:14,844
Before Aegon's death, the
last of the Valyrian pyromancers

565
00:54:14,868 --> 00:54:16,385
hid his song in the steel.

566
00:54:23,168 --> 00:54:26,772
Rhaenyra:
"From my blood..."

567
00:54:26,796 --> 00:54:30,190
"Come the Prince
That Was Promised..."

568
00:54:32,177 --> 00:54:35,779
"And his will be
the Song of Ice and Fire."

569
00:54:40,185 --> 00:54:43,664
The responsibility
I have handed to you,

570
00:54:43,688 --> 00:54:45,956
the burden of this knowledge...

571
00:54:47,150 --> 00:54:50,671
it is larger than the throne,
the king.

572
00:54:50,695 --> 00:54:52,214
It is larger than you

573
00:54:52,238 --> 00:54:54,381
and your desires.

574
00:54:59,037 --> 00:55:01,557
Jaehaerys would've
disinherited you.

575
00:55:01,581 --> 00:55:02,764
For a lie?

576
00:55:04,167 --> 00:55:06,854
You've yet to ask me for
the truth of what happened.

577
00:55:06,878 --> 00:55:09,482
The truth does not
matter, Rhaenyra.

578
00:55:09,506 --> 00:55:11,358
Only perception.

579
00:55:11,382 --> 00:55:12,359
You have exposed yourself.

580
00:55:12,383 --> 00:55:15,780
Now we must both
suffer the consequences.

581
00:55:15,804 --> 00:55:19,784
Were I born a man,
I could bed whomever I wanted.

582
00:55:19,808 --> 00:55:21,410
I could father a dozen bastards,

583
00:55:21,434 --> 00:55:23,412
and no one in your court
would blink an eye.

584
00:55:23,436 --> 00:55:27,708
You are right...
but you were born a woman.

585
00:55:27,732 --> 00:55:31,378
So you'll strip me of my titles
and name Aegon in my stead.

586
00:55:31,402 --> 00:55:33,547
I would.

587
00:55:33,571 --> 00:55:36,008
But it is mine to hold
the realm together,

588
00:55:36,032 --> 00:55:37,841
not sow it
with further division.

589
00:55:39,619 --> 00:55:42,223
Your courtship is at an end.

590
00:55:42,247 --> 00:55:44,558
You will wed
Ser Laenor Velaryon,

591
00:55:44,582 --> 00:55:47,059
and you will do so
without protest.

592
00:55:47,669 --> 00:55:50,106
The son of the Sea Snake.

593
00:55:50,130 --> 00:55:52,691
So I can be a remedy
for your political headaches.

594
00:55:52,715 --> 00:55:55,525
You are my political headache!

595
00:55:59,806 --> 00:56:02,118
Your wedding
to Ser Laenor Velaryon

596
00:56:02,142 --> 00:56:04,912
will unite the two most
powerful houses in the realm.

597
00:56:04,936 --> 00:56:09,208
With the combined strength of
our shared dragons and naval fleets,

598
00:56:09,232 --> 00:56:10,918
no one would dare
to stand against us.

599
00:56:10,942 --> 00:56:12,378
The House of the Dragon

600
00:56:12,402 --> 00:56:15,840
will stand as one
for a further generation.

601
00:56:15,864 --> 00:56:17,299
And what will you
do about the vulture

602
00:56:17,323 --> 00:56:20,094
who perches upon your throne?

603
00:56:20,118 --> 00:56:21,551
What vulture?

604
00:56:22,120 --> 00:56:25,015
Your Hand.

605
00:56:25,039 --> 00:56:29,351
Otto High tower has served
two kings loyally and faithfully.

606
00:56:30,336 --> 00:56:33,065
He wants Aegon to be named heir.

607
00:56:33,089 --> 00:56:35,651
And he will stop at nothing
to see it done.

608
00:56:35,675 --> 00:56:38,777
Including spying on me
to bring about my ruin.

609
00:56:39,596 --> 00:56:42,741
You speak of
The Conqueror's vision

610
00:56:42,765 --> 00:56:45,286
and the need for strength
and unity across the realm.

611
00:56:45,310 --> 00:56:47,788
But how can that be accomplished

612
00:56:47,812 --> 00:56:49,582
with your most trusted adviser
so self-interested?

613
00:56:49,606 --> 00:56:52,126
Every lord and lady that calls
for an audience with me,

614
00:56:52,150 --> 00:56:54,920
every man on my small council,

615
00:56:54,944 --> 00:56:58,048
and all councils past,
has been self-interested.

616
00:56:58,072 --> 00:57:00,509
- It is unavoidable.
- I disagree.

617
00:57:00,533 --> 00:57:03,095
I will do my duty as heir

618
00:57:03,119 --> 00:57:04,803
and wed Ser Laenor.

619
00:57:07,123 --> 00:57:09,891
But you must first
do yours as king.

620
00:57:20,220 --> 00:57:22,446
- (door closes)
- Your Grace.

621
00:57:24,974 --> 00:57:26,366
Five days.

622
00:57:29,604 --> 00:57:31,498
I'm sorry, Your Grace?

623
00:57:31,522 --> 00:57:34,084
King Viserys:
Though it was some time ago.

624
00:57:34,108 --> 00:57:38,005
The details...
they fade in memory.

625
00:57:38,029 --> 00:57:41,508
My father was a hale and
healthy warrior and dragon rider

626
00:57:41,532 --> 00:57:43,344
at the peak of his abilities.

627
00:57:43,368 --> 00:57:46,013
Jaehaerys named
a great royal hunt

628
00:57:46,037 --> 00:57:48,430
to celebrate him being
named the Hand of the King.

629
00:57:49,540 --> 00:57:54,144
Five days later my...
my father lay dead.

630
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:57,481
Tourneys last longer.

631
00:57:58,216 --> 00:58:01,403
Baelon the Brave,

632
00:58:01,427 --> 00:58:03,572
rider of Vhagar,

633
00:58:03,596 --> 00:58:05,572
heir to the Iron Throne...

634
00:58:06,140 --> 00:58:09,076
dead of a burst belly.

635
00:58:11,020 --> 00:58:13,540
The gods have a dark wit.

636
00:58:13,564 --> 00:58:14,706
It was a grim day.

637
00:58:16,734 --> 00:58:19,503
- I recall it all too well.
- Yeah...

638
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:22,506
It was a good day for you.

639
00:58:23,658 --> 00:58:26,468
Jaehaerys named you Hand
in Baelon's stead.

640
00:58:29,580 --> 00:58:32,641
That's hardly how
I viewed it, Your Grace.

641
00:58:33,543 --> 00:58:35,227
It was a duty.

642
00:58:37,839 --> 00:58:41,691
You served my grand sire
nobly in his final days.

643
00:58:43,052 --> 00:58:45,487
You are the man that
taught me how to be King.

644
00:58:47,307 --> 00:58:51,412
- Oh, you honor me, Your Grace.
- (King Viserys sighs)

645
00:58:51,436 --> 00:58:53,120
Just five days...

646
00:58:54,731 --> 00:58:58,168
you went from being another man
in Jaehaerys's court,

647
00:58:58,192 --> 00:59:00,335
to the second most
powerful man in the realm.

648
00:59:01,529 --> 00:59:02,671
I wonder...

649
00:59:04,115 --> 00:59:07,008
how long did it take you to
choose yourself over your King?

650
00:59:09,120 --> 00:59:11,263
Your Grace?

651
00:59:12,457 --> 00:59:15,058
I will never recover
from Aemma's death.

652
00:59:15,460 --> 00:59:18,147
But Alicent...

653
00:59:18,171 --> 00:59:20,272
she took me through
the worst of my grief.

654
00:59:22,633 --> 00:59:25,360
She was a calculated
distraction.

655
00:59:26,387 --> 00:59:29,742
I only now realize
how well-calculated it was.

656
00:59:29,766 --> 00:59:32,786
That is an absurdity.

657
00:59:32,810 --> 00:59:34,744
The Queen loves you...

658
00:59:36,105 --> 00:59:38,000
as I know you love her.

659
00:59:38,024 --> 00:59:40,669
Your interests no longer align
with those of the realm.

660
00:59:40,693 --> 00:59:44,006
Your judgment has
been compromised.

661
00:59:44,030 --> 00:59:46,633
A loyal Hand must tell his king

662
00:59:46,657 --> 00:59:49,803
a discomforting truth
from time to time, Your Grace.

663
00:59:49,827 --> 00:59:51,553
If he doesn't...

664
00:59:52,830 --> 00:59:54,848
he's failed as a servant.

665
00:59:55,833 --> 00:59:58,351
You were a faithful
servant, Otto.

666
01:00:07,929 --> 01:00:09,698
The crown and the realm

667
01:00:09,722 --> 01:00:12,782
both owe you a debt
that can never be repaid.

668
01:00:13,976 --> 01:00:16,580
But I can no longer
trust your judgment.

669

I took great care

A tea, Princess.
