since I last saw
my lord husband, Maester.

4
00:02:23,602 --> 00:02:27,565
I must know... will he live?

5
00:02:27,648 --> 00:02:30,066

into an ambush.

A ship made to look
as if it were abandoned.

7
00:02:34,321 --> 00:02:38,741
In the fighting,
his neck was slashed by a corsair's dagger.

8
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:41,370
He fell overboard into the sea.

9
00:02:41,453 --> 00:02:43,413
The wound was severe.

10
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:45,124
Much blood was lost.

11
00:02:45,206 --> 00:02:48,085
But the greater concern
is the fever that followed.

12
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:52,089

he burns from within.

The Sea Snake is strong.

VAEMOND VELARYON: No doubt.

20
00:03:26,624 --> 00:03:31,461
And yet, I have seen
blood fever overcome men half his age.

21
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:34,673
I will not suffer the talk
of crows in my house, Vaemond.

23

with ourselves.

your words for treason.

for the history books.

41

But what of the Velaryon line?

42
00:04:37,568 --> 00:04:39,196
Is it to be snuffed out,

have your tongue for this.

710
01:00:29,668 --> 01:00:33,963
let us drain our cups
to these three...

711
01:00:34,048 --> 01:00:35,441
- Strong boys.
- I dare you to say that again.

712
01:00:35,465 --> 01:00:39,345
Why? 'Twas only a compliment.

713
01:00:39,427 --> 01:00:41,555
Do you not think
yourself Strong?

718
01:00:50,104 --> 01:00:51,874
Why would you
say such a thing before these people?

719
01:00:51,898 --> 01:00:55,903
I was merely expressing
how proud I am of my family, Mother.

720
01:00:55,985 --> 01:00:59,865
Mm, though it seems
my nephews aren't quite as proud of theirs.

Rhaenyra.

727
01:01:32,856 --> 01:01:35,526
It's best, I think, if we
go back to Dragons tone.

728
01:01:35,608 --> 01:01:36,693
You've only just arrived.

729
01:01:43,534 --> 01:01:44,700
Let me see the children home.

return on dragon back.

732

But you wanted to know...

748
01:03:57,334 --> 01:03:59,418
if I believe it to be true.

749
01:04:01,338 --> 01:04:03,215

my King?
