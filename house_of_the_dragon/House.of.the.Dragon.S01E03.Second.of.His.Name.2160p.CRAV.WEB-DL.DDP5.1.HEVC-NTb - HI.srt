532
00:41:07,654 --> 00:41:10,573
- Rhaenyra is a woman.
- What of my son?

533
00:41:10,657 --> 00:41:13,618
Would you have me raise a man
to steal his own sister's birthright?

534
00:41:13,702 --> 00:41:16,466
It is Aegon that's being robbed.

535
00:41:16,705 --> 00:41:18,665
He's the firstborn
son of the King.

536
00:41:18,749 --> 00:41:20,875
To deny that he
is heir to the throne

537
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:23,646
is to assail the laws
of gods and men.

538
00:41:25,310 --> 00:41:29,326
The road ahead is uncertain,
but the end is clear.

539
00:41:29,441 --> 00:41:31,447
Aegon will be king.

540
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:36,083
You must guide
Viserys towards reason.

541
00:41:38,727 --> 00:41:40,775
<i>He'll never find it on his own.</i>

542
00:41:48,654 --> 00:41:50,139
How are you feeling, husband?

543
00:41:50,224 --> 00:41:53,131
The gods have punished me
for my indulgences.

544
00:41:53,237 --> 00:41:54,061
(Door closes)

545
00:41:54,146 --> 00:41:55,590
At least the wine was good.

546
00:41:55,675 --> 00:41:57,263
Too good.

547
00:42:00,165 --> 00:42:02,443
(King Viserys sighing)

548
00:42:09,227 --> 00:42:11,310
I was hoping we might
discuss something.

549
00:42:14,427 --> 00:42:15,807
Rhaenyra?

550
00:42:17,886 --> 00:42:19,679
(Sighs)

551
00:42:19,810 --> 00:42:22,623
I do not think she enjoyed
Jason Lannister's company.

552
00:42:23,564 --> 00:42:25,318
She is cross.

553
00:42:25,748 --> 00:42:27,582
I warned you that she would be.

554
00:42:27,776 --> 00:42:29,736
Rhaenyra has come of age.

555
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:31,616
She must needs
marry a high lord

556
00:42:31,701 --> 00:42:32,843
who will honor her,
defend her,

557
00:42:32,927 --> 00:42:34,748
and serve her as king consort.

558
00:42:35,150 --> 00:42:37,860
Her wishes in this matter
are irrelevant.

559
00:42:38,078 --> 00:42:41,162
I do believe that Rhaenyra
will marry, Your Grace.

560
00:42:41,841 --> 00:42:44,270
But she must believe
it is her choice to do so.

561
00:42:44,404 --> 00:42:47,693
(Sighs)

562
00:42:53,502 --> 00:42:55,982
- What's this?
- A letter...

563
00:42:57,958 --> 00:43:00,044
from Vaemond Velaryon.

564
00:43:00,254 --> 00:43:03,169
- The Sea Snake's brother.
- Yeah.

565
00:43:03,807 --> 00:43:06,100
He's fighting
in the Step stones,

566
00:43:06,356 --> 00:43:08,099
with all the rest of them.

567
00:43:13,422 --> 00:43:15,068
May I?

568
00:43:25,393 --> 00:43:28,076
Lord Corlys and Prince Daemon
are losing their war.

569
00:43:28,701 --> 00:43:30,958
Badly, by all accounts.

570
00:43:31,686 --> 00:43:33,692
This is a plea for aid.

571
00:43:36,177 --> 00:43:37,990
Then why not send it?

572
00:43:38,075 --> 00:43:41,240
Because it is a war
started by two malcontents,

573
00:43:41,391 --> 00:43:43,689
unhappy with decisions I made.

574
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:47,685
If I now provide
Daemon and Corlys succor,

575
00:43:48,138 --> 00:43:49,633
what will that say
of their king?

576
00:43:49,733 --> 00:43:52,569
Perhaps, that he is a good
man who loves his brother.

577
00:43:52,654 --> 00:43:55,255
Well, if you truly
believe that, my dear...

578
00:43:56,031 --> 00:43:58,388
then you possess
a generous spirit.

579
00:43:59,704 --> 00:44:01,912
What do you believe, Viserys?

580
00:44:05,286 --> 00:44:07,694
That I am forever doomed
to anger one person

581
00:44:07,779 --> 00:44:09,599
in the pleasing of another.

582
00:44:10,045 --> 00:44:12,310
Then I pose a simpler question.

583
00:44:13,048 --> 00:44:15,873
Is it better for the realm
if the Crabfeeder thrives,

584
00:44:16,093 --> 00:44:17,537
or is vanquished?

585
00:44:20,942 --> 00:44:22,927
(Door opens)

586
00:44:24,458 --> 00:44:26,477
King Viserys: Make haste
to Dwarfstone, Ser Addam.

587
00:44:26,561 --> 00:44:28,841
Hand-deliver this
to Prince Daemon yourself.

588
00:44:29,052 --> 00:44:30,736
At once, Your Grace.

589
00:44:39,115 --> 00:44:42,409
- Dwarfstone?
- I'm sending word to Daemon.

590
00:44:42,619 --> 00:44:44,841
Aid is sailing
to the Step stones.

591
00:44:46,123 --> 00:44:49,263
- Did he make call for help?
- He would sooner die.

592
00:44:50,002 --> 00:44:52,349
But his king does not
mean to allow that.

593
00:44:56,842 --> 00:44:59,021
Do you not think
my decision correct?

594
00:44:59,219 --> 00:45:01,513
It is no consequence
to what I think...

595
00:45:01,763 --> 00:45:03,728
as I'm often reminded.

596
00:45:06,114 --> 00:45:08,628
Daemon is thorn enough
in my flesh.

597
00:45:09,325 --> 00:45:11,917
Will you insist
on taking after him?

598
00:45:12,816 --> 00:45:14,621
Must everything be a battle?

599
00:45:14,706 --> 00:45:18,143
If you refer to your attempt to
marry me off to Casterly Rock.

600
00:45:18,245 --> 00:45:20,862
(Sighs) I am sorry, Rhaenyra.

601
00:45:22,064 --> 00:45:23,948
I was trying to help you.

602
00:45:24,453 --> 00:45:26,026
Will you not be helped?

603
00:45:26,788 --> 00:45:30,151
Why must every effort
on your behalf be resisted

604
00:45:30,334 --> 00:45:33,471
- as if to the death?
- Because you mean to replace me...

605
00:45:34,152 --> 00:45:36,279
with Alicent Hightower's son,

606
00:45:36,682 --> 00:45:39,042
the boy you always wanted.

607
00:45:39,551 --> 00:45:40,871
You have him in hands now.

608
00:45:40,956 --> 00:45:43,729
Y-You have no
further use for me.

609
00:45:43,972 --> 00:45:46,214
You might as well peddle me
for what you can.

610
00:45:46,475 --> 00:45:49,714
A mountain stronghold
or a fleet of ships.

611
00:45:49,991 --> 00:45:52,020
You have misjudged me, Rhaenyra.

612
00:45:52,105 --> 00:45:53,612
All know it.

613
00:45:54,066 --> 00:45:55,698
Jason Lannister knows it.

614
00:45:56,221 --> 00:45:57,735
You said it yourself,

615
00:45:57,819 --> 00:46:00,676
the lords of the realm gather
like vultures to a carcass,

616
00:46:00,761 --> 00:46:02,787
hoping to feast on my bones.

617
00:46:05,110 --> 00:46:09,030
It is true that as rulers
we must marry for advantage

618
00:46:09,443 --> 00:46:12,354
to forge alliances
and bolster our strength.

619
00:46:12,542 --> 00:46:15,112
You have always understood this.

620
00:46:15,670 --> 00:46:17,761
I myself was promised
to your mother when I was...

621
00:46:17,846 --> 00:46:20,215
Ten-and-seven years of age.

622
00:46:20,300 --> 00:46:22,240
The Vale had an army
to rival the North.

623

I've heard that story
since I've had ears to.

624
00:46:25,865 --> 00:46:27,503
I loved her.

625
00:46:28,517 --> 00:46:30,147
She made a man of me.

626
00:46:33,563 --> 00:46:36,070
I do not seek
to replace you, child.

627
00:46:37,526 --> 00:46:39,800
You've been much alone
these last few years.

628
00:46:39,986 --> 00:46:41,909
Alone and angry.

629
00:46:43,323 --> 00:46:45,026

- I had a family.

What would you have me do?!

635

you would've wed Laena Velaryon!

That is true enough.

637
00:47:06,190 --> 00:47:08,159
