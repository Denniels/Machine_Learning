1
00:05:24,482 --> 00:05:27,527
Have you seen your father?

2
00:05:28,277 --> 00:05:31,280
Your little cousins
have lost their mother.

3
00:05:31,364 --> 00:05:32,990
They could use a kind word.

4
00:05:32,991 --> 00:05:34,074
I have an equal
claim to sympathy.

5
00:05:34,075 --> 00:05:36,827
- Jace.
- We should be at Harrenhal,

6
00:05:36,828 --> 00:05:38,830
mourning Lord Lyonel
and Ser Harwin.

7
00:05:40,081 --> 00:05:42,499
It would not be appropriate.

8
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:46,254
The Velaryons are our kin
and the Strongs are not.

9
00:05:47,755 --> 00:05:49,048
Look at me.

10
00:05:49,632 --> 00:05:51,217
Do you understand?

11
00:06:19,954 --> 00:06:21,497
<i>Hand turns loom;</i>

12
00:06:21,581 --> 00:06:23,582
spool of green, spool of black;

13
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:25,042
dragons of flesh

14
00:06:25,043 --> 00:06:28,504
weaving dragons of thread.

15
00:06:28,588 --> 00:06:31,924
Hand turns loom;
spool of green...

16
00:06:32,008 --> 00:06:34,343
- We have nothing in common.
- She's our sister.

17
00:06:34,427 --> 00:06:37,972
- You marry her, then.
- I would perform my duty,

18
00:06:38,056 --> 00:06:40,766
- if mother had only betrothed us.
- - If only.

19
00:06:40,767 --> 00:06:42,393
It would strengthen the family.

20
00:06:42,477 --> 00:06:43,353
Keep our Valyrian blood pure.

21
00:06:43,354 --> 00:06:46,981
- She's an idiot.
- She's your future queen.

22
00:06:49,233 --> 00:06:51,360
We actually do have

23
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,946
one thing in common.

24
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:57,533
We both fancy creatures
with very long legs.

25
00:06:59,702 --> 00:07:01,204
Wench!

26
00:07:01,871 --> 00:07:04,832
- Another!
- Aegon.

27
00:07:04,916 --> 00:07:07,752
Dragon's flesh,
weaving dragons of thread.

28
00:07:16,761 --> 00:07:18,595
Lyonel Strong's son's
been staring at you

29
00:07:18,596 --> 00:07:20,598
since the moment we arrived,
Your Grace.

30
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,145
Unabashedly.

31
00:07:27,438 --> 00:07:30,983
It is only a look of pride,
Ser Criston.

32
00:07:31,067 --> 00:07:32,527
Larys is the new
Lord of Harrenhal.

33
00:08:07,562 --> 00:08:10,564
Both my seat and High Tide

34
00:08:10,565 --> 00:08:12,567
will be yours one day, Lucerys.

35
00:08:13,693 --> 00:08:16,695
Your brother will be king,
of course.

36
00:08:16,696 --> 00:08:19,323
He'll sit on endless
councils and ceremonies,

37
00:08:19,407 --> 00:08:22,076
but Lord of the Tides
rules the sea.

38
00:08:22,952 --> 00:08:24,203
Sorry.

39
00:08:24,287 --> 00:08:25,872
I don't want it.

40
00:08:29,167 --> 00:08:31,294
It's your birthright, lad.

41
00:08:35,381 --> 00:08:38,384
If I'm the Lord of Driftmark,
it means everyone's dead.

42
00:08:46,142 --> 00:08:49,061
- I'm very sorry.
- Thank you. Thank you.

43
00:09:11,918 --> 00:09:14,045
Grandma...

44
00:09:18,341 --> 00:09:19,581
I don't want Mother to be gone.

45
00:10:34,667 --> 00:10:36,294
Retrieve your patron.

46
00:10:39,755 --> 00:10:40,798
Brother.

47
00:11:22,256 --> 00:11:24,717
Your girls are the very
image of their mother.

48
00:11:26,093 --> 00:11:28,053
A comfort and an anguish,

49
00:11:28,054 --> 00:11:30,222
as I well remember.

50
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:32,933
The gods can be cruel.

51
00:11:35,311 --> 00:11:37,480
It seems they've been
especially cruel to you.

52
00:11:38,481 --> 00:11:39,565
Yes.

53
00:11:55,122 --> 00:11:57,874
You should return with us
to King's Landing.

54
00:11:57,875 --> 00:11:59,543
It's time that you came home.

55
00:11:59,627 --> 00:12:01,504
Pentos is my home...

56
00:12:02,463 --> 00:12:05,091
- and that of my children.
- Daemon...

57
00:12:06,092 --> 00:12:08,552
I know we've had
our differences,

58
00:12:08,636 --> 00:12:09,916
but let them pass
with the years.

59
00:12:12,348 --> 00:12:14,391
There's a place for you
in my court

60
00:12:14,392 --> 00:12:15,786
if that's something
you should need.

61
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:18,437
I need... nothing.

62
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:31,075
Brother.

63
00:12:34,203 --> 00:12:37,247
I'm sorry for your loss,
my Prince.

64
00:12:37,248 --> 00:12:38,915
No matter how fat
the leech grows,

65
00:12:38,916 --> 00:12:40,918
it always wants
for another meal.

66
00:12:52,096 --> 00:12:52,721
Go to bed.

67
00:12:52,805 --> 00:12:55,474
- But, Mother...
- Go to bed.

68
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,945
I'm going to bed, Aemma.

69
00:13:09,071 --> 00:13:12,658
Shall I see after
Queen Alicent,
Your Grace?

70
00:13:15,327 --> 00:13:17,662
No, Ser Harrold.

71
00:13:17,663 --> 00:13:19,707
You have the night's watch,
Ser Criston.

72
00:13:22,084 --> 00:13:23,961
Lord Commander.

73
00:13:56,577 --> 00:13:58,120
Brother?

74
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:04,710
Get to bed.

75
00:15:06,981 --> 00:15:09,524
She wanted to come home

76
00:15:09,525 --> 00:15:11,485
and he denied her.

77
00:15:12,319 --> 00:15:15,030
Daemon did what he thought best.

78
00:15:16,073 --> 00:15:19,451
Daemon only ever does
what is best for Daemon.

79
00:15:20,995 --> 00:15:23,080
Laena needed our maesters.

80
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:31,129
The surgeons in Pentos
are as well-trained

81
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:34,258
as our maesters.

82
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:39,554
You are looking to place blame

83
00:15:39,555 --> 00:15:41,724
for an act of the gods.

84
00:15:43,183 --> 00:15:45,227
Mayhaps the gods
have scorned us...

85
00:15:46,812 --> 00:15:49,982
for our insatiable pride.

86
00:15:55,821 --> 00:15:57,656
The crown was yours

87
00:15:57,740 --> 00:16:00,367
until those fools
at the Great Council

88
00:16:00,451 --> 00:16:02,119
plucked it from your head.

89
00:16:04,788 --> 00:16:06,706
Is it such a terrible thing

90
00:16:06,707 --> 00:16:08,458
for your husband
to wish to win it back?

91
00:16:08,459 --> 00:16:10,836
Tonight of all nights,
let us lay aside
this falsehood.

92
00:16:15,174 --> 00:16:16,341
It is not justice for
your wife that drives you.

93
00:16:16,342 --> 00:16:19,761
It is your own ambition.

94
00:16:19,762 --> 00:16:21,763
'Tis desire for the throne,

95
00:16:21,764 --> 00:16:24,266
if not for yourself,
then for the scions
of your house.

96
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:27,686
I gave up the idea
of wearing a crown
a generation ago.

97
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:28,853
It is you, lord husband,

98
00:16:28,854 --> 00:16:30,855
who refuses
to abandon this pursuit,

99
00:16:30,856 --> 00:16:33,692
even now,
at the cost of our children.

100
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:51,460
What is this brief
mortal life...

101
00:16:52,252 --> 00:16:54,462
if not the pursuit of legacy?

102
00:16:54,463 --> 00:16:57,383
Legacy may be why you
live your life, Corlys.

103
00:17:08,894 --> 00:17:12,398
I want Driftmark
to pass through
Laena's line to Baela.

104
00:17:13,524 --> 00:17:16,360
To true Velaryon blood.

105
00:17:17,444 --> 00:17:19,571
Declare it now,
while all are gathered here,

106
00:17:19,655 --> 00:17:22,073
and we will say
that is how we will honor
Laena's memory.

107
00:17:22,074 --> 00:17:24,409
And disinherit our son?

108
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:26,745
He will be the King Consort.

109
00:17:26,829 --> 00:17:27,829
His son will one day
sit the Iron Throne.

110
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:31,541
You would have me cast
an even darker shadow

111
00:17:31,542 --> 00:17:32,542
over those little boys
than already exists.

112
00:17:32,543 --> 00:17:34,878
We are alone here, husband.

113
00:17:34,962 --> 00:17:37,006
You can speak the plain truth
as we both know it:

114
00:17:45,055 --> 00:17:47,349
Rhaenyra's children
are not of your blood.

115
00:17:55,315 --> 00:17:57,109
But Laena's are.

116
00:18:00,529 --> 00:18:02,614
They are her legacy.

117
00:18:03,741 --> 00:18:07,411
History does not remember blood.

118
00:18:12,124 --> 00:18:13,959
It remembers names.

119
00:18:34,354 --> 00:18:37,691
Laenor has been
restless for years,

120
00:18:37,775 --> 00:18:41,486
but now, he will be useless.

121
00:18:41,487 --> 00:18:43,614
Or worse.

122
00:18:45,449 --> 00:18:50,203
I know better than anyone
that our marriage is a farce.

123
00:18:50,204 --> 00:18:54,041
But I at least make the effort
to maintain appearances.

124
00:18:55,542 --> 00:18:57,335
You have more to lose.

125
00:18:57,336 --> 00:19:01,924
Yes, well, that has been
my lot since my father
named me heir.

126
00:19:03,634 --> 00:19:06,011
We did try...

127
00:19:07,721 --> 00:19:09,055
to conceive a child.

128
00:19:09,056 --> 00:19:13,393
We performed our duty
as best we could.

129
00:19:16,104 --> 00:19:17,689
But to no avail.

130
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:26,824
There was no joy in it.

131
00:19:30,744 --> 00:19:32,830
I found that elsewhere.

132
00:19:34,957 --> 00:19:38,335
- It felt good to be desired.
- Hm.

133
00:19:40,003 --> 00:19:43,465
I understand
Ser Harwin was quite...

134
00:19:45,634 --> 00:19:47,469
devoted to you.

135
00:19:49,596 --> 00:19:51,098
Yes, he was.

136
00:19:52,975 --> 00:19:54,560
And I trusted him.

137
00:19:59,690 --> 00:20:02,170
Should've forbidden
Ser Harwin from returning
to the Riverlands.

138
00:20:04,695 --> 00:20:05,797
Harren's curse is said
to be as strong now

139
00:20:05,821 --> 00:20:07,947
as it was after the Conquest.

140
00:20:07,948 --> 00:20:09,407
That's a ghost story,

141
00:20:09,408 --> 00:20:12,035
one Ser Otto and the Queen
would gladly exploit.

142
00:20:12,119 --> 00:20:16,582
I do not believe Alicent
capable of cold murder.

143
00:20:17,749 --> 00:20:20,752
Mm.

144
00:20:20,836 --> 00:20:23,297
Each of us is capable
of depravity.

145
00:20:24,131 --> 00:20:26,967
And more than you would believe.

146
00:20:30,429 --> 00:20:32,264
I believe it of you.

147
00:20:34,641 --> 00:20:36,201
If you're accusing me
of some depravity,

148
00:20:36,268 --> 00:20:38,395
you'll need to be more specific.

149
00:20:39,563 --> 00:20:42,316
I've been alone.

150
00:20:43,609 --> 00:20:44,859
- You abandoned me.
- I spared you.

151
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:48,488
- You were a child.
- Yes.

152
00:20:48,572 --> 00:20:50,156
Yes, I was a child.

153
00:20:50,157 --> 00:20:52,993
And look at what my life
became without you.

154
00:20:54,661 --> 00:20:59,415
- Droll tragedy.
- Oh, and I wonder what you
think of mine by comparison?

155
00:20:59,416 --> 00:21:02,502
I know little of it.

156
00:21:06,757 --> 00:21:08,383
Did you love her?

157
00:21:11,053 --> 00:21:12,930
We were happy enough.

158
00:21:14,264 --> 00:21:17,017
Well, that in itself
is a great achievement.

159
00:21:21,897 --> 00:21:24,775
- I am sorry.
- Don't be.

160
00:21:26,902 --> 00:21:29,363
I am at least allowed
to mourn my losses.

161
00:21:59,810 --> 00:22:01,269
Rhaenyra.

162
00:22:06,566 --> 00:22:08,402
I'm no longer a child.

163
00:22:27,629 --> 00:22:29,256
I want you.

164
00:25:30,979 --> 00:25:33,315
Fuck.

165
00:27:01,444 --> 00:27:04,947
<i>Dohaeras!</i>

166
00:27:04,948 --> 00:27:08,326
<i>Dohaeras, Vhagar! Lykiri!</i>

167
00:27:09,577 --> 00:27:10,577
<i>Lykiri!</i>

168
00:27:14,958 --> 00:27:17,002
<i>Lykiri.</i>

169
00:28:05,759 --> 00:28:08,636
<i>Soves!</i>

170
00:28:09,304 --> 00:28:13,641
<i>Dohaeras, Vhagar! Soves!</i>

171
00:28:16,436 --> 00:28:17,812
Ah!

172
00:28:22,817 --> 00:28:26,237
Ah! Ahh!

173
00:28:53,933 --> 00:28:56,017
Ah!

174
00:30:03,251 --> 00:30:04,251
Yeah!

175
00:30:27,984 --> 00:30:30,361
Jace, Jace.

176
00:30:30,445 --> 00:30:33,072
Jace, wake up. Wake up.

177
00:30:34,782 --> 00:30:37,869
- Someone stole Vhagar.
- What?

178
00:30:57,764 --> 00:31:00,808
Who is it?

179
00:31:22,497 --> 00:31:25,583
Jace, what are we doing?

180
00:31:25,667 --> 00:31:26,917
- It's him.
- It's me.

181
00:31:26,918 --> 00:31:30,921
- Vhagar is my mother's dragon.
- Your mother's dead.

182
00:31:30,922 --> 00:31:32,650
- And Vhagar has a new rider now.
- She was mine to claim.

183
00:31:32,674 --> 00:31:35,301
Then you should've claimed her!

184
00:31:35,385 --> 00:31:37,636
Maybe your cousins
can find you a pig to ride.

185
00:31:37,637 --> 00:31:39,681
- It would suit you.

186
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:46,937
Come at me again
and I'll feed you to my dragon!

187
00:31:52,151 --> 00:31:53,652
Ah!

188
00:32:18,678 --> 00:32:20,429
You will die screaming in flames

189
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:22,139
just as your father did!

190
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:23,432
Bastards.

191
00:32:23,433 --> 00:32:26,060
My father's still alive.

192
00:32:26,144 --> 00:32:27,854
He doesn't know, does he,
Lord Strong?

193
00:32:31,232 --> 00:32:32,275
Jace!

194
00:32:52,462 --> 00:32:54,440
Cease this at once!

195
00:32:54,464 --> 00:32:56,507
Get away!

196
00:32:59,093 --> 00:33:02,013
My Prince, my Prince.
Let me see.

197
00:33:05,642 --> 00:33:07,769
Gods be good.

198
00:33:08,936 --> 00:33:11,648
How could you allow
such a thing to happen?

199
00:33:13,816 --> 00:33:15,359
I will have answers.

200
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:18,571
The princes were supposed
to be abed, My King.

201
00:33:18,655 --> 00:33:20,823
Who had the watch?

202
00:33:20,907 --> 00:33:23,617
Young prince was attacked by
his own cousins, Your Grace.

203
00:33:23,618 --> 00:33:26,870
You swore oaths to protect
and defend my blood!

204
00:33:26,871 --> 00:33:29,373
I'm very sorry, Your Grace.

205
00:33:29,374 --> 00:33:31,625
The Kingsguard has
never had to defend
princes from princes,

206
00:33:31,626 --> 00:33:32,918
- Your Grace.
- That is no answer!

207
00:33:32,919 --> 00:33:36,047
It will heal,
will it not, maester?

208
00:33:38,216 --> 00:33:39,676
The flesh will heal.

209
00:33:41,803 --> 00:33:44,013
But the eye is lost, Your Grace.

210
00:33:47,266 --> 00:33:49,518
- Where were you?
- Me?

211
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:51,353
- Ow! What was that for?
- That was nothing

212
00:33:51,354 --> 00:33:53,105
compared to the abuse
your brother suffered

213
00:33:53,106 --> 00:33:55,107
while you were drowning
in your cups, you fool.

214
00:33:55,108 --> 00:33:57,735
What is the meaning of this?

215
00:33:57,819 --> 00:34:00,237
Baela, Rhaena!

216
00:34:00,238 --> 00:34:01,364
What happened?

217
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:07,537
Jace?

218
00:34:07,912 --> 00:34:09,414
Luke!

219
00:34:11,207 --> 00:34:13,500
Show me. Show me.

220
00:34:13,501 --> 00:34:15,085
- Who did this?
- They attacked me!

221
00:34:15,086 --> 00:34:16,806
- He attacked Baela!
- He broke Luke's nose!

222
00:34:21,843 --> 00:34:24,803
He stole my mother's dragon!

223
00:34:24,804 --> 00:34:26,972
- Enough.
- He was
gonna kill Jace!

224
00:34:26,973 --> 00:34:28,098
- I didn't do anything!
- Enough...

225
00:34:28,099 --> 00:34:29,642
It should be my son
telling the tale!

226
00:34:29,726 --> 00:34:31,644
- He called us...
- Silence!

227
00:34:35,356 --> 00:34:37,525
He called us bastards.

228
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:45,783
Aemond...

229
00:34:45,867 --> 00:34:47,660
I will have the truth
of what happened.

230
00:34:48,828 --> 00:34:51,789
- Now.
- What else is there to hear?

231
00:34:51,873 --> 00:34:52,998
Your son has been maimed.
Her son is responsible.

232
00:34:52,999 --> 00:34:56,085
- It was a regrettable accident.
- Accident?

233
00:34:56,169 --> 00:34:57,544
The Prince Lucerys brought
a blade to the ambush.

234
00:34:57,545 --> 00:35:00,047
He meant to kill my son.

235
00:35:00,131 --> 00:35:01,799
It was my sons who were attacked

236
00:35:01,883 --> 00:35:05,427
and forced to defend themselves.

237
00:35:05,428 --> 00:35:07,471
Vile insults were
levied against them.

238
00:35:07,472 --> 00:35:09,098
What insults?

239
00:35:13,644 --> 00:35:17,064
The legitimacy
of my sons' birth was
put loudly to question.

240
00:35:17,148 --> 00:35:19,817
- What?
- He called us bastards.

241
00:35:24,739 --> 00:35:28,992
My sons are in line to inherit
the Iron Throne, Your Grace.

242
00:35:28,993 --> 00:35:31,412
This is the highest of treasons.

243
00:35:32,914 --> 00:35:34,832
Prince Aemond must
be sharply questioned

244
00:35:34,916 --> 00:35:37,877
so we might learn where
he heard such slanders.

245
00:35:39,378 --> 00:35:40,922
Over an insult?

246
00:35:41,756 --> 00:35:44,050
My son has lost an eye.

247
00:35:46,719 --> 00:35:49,680
You tell me, boy.
Where did you hear this lie?

248
00:35:49,764 --> 00:35:51,325
The insult was
training yard bluster.

249
00:35:51,349 --> 00:35:53,684
- The lot of boys.
It was nothing.
- Aemond...

250
00:35:53,768 --> 00:35:55,436
I asked you a question.

251
00:35:58,564 --> 00:36:01,567
Where is Ser Laenor, I wonder?
The boys' father?

252
00:36:01,651 --> 00:36:03,610
Perhaps he might have
something to say in the matter.

253
00:36:03,611 --> 00:36:05,237
Yes. Where is Ser Laenor?

254
00:36:05,238 --> 00:36:09,783
I do not know, Your Grace.
I... could not find sleep.

255
00:36:09,784 --> 00:36:11,869
I had gone out to walk.

256
00:36:11,953 --> 00:36:14,121
Entertaining
his young squires,
I would venture.

257
00:36:18,251 --> 00:36:19,335
Aemond...

258
00:36:20,878 --> 00:36:23,923
look at me.

259
00:36:24,465 --> 00:36:26,550
Your king demands an answer.

260
00:36:26,551 --> 00:36:28,761
Who spoke these lies to you?

261
00:36:46,237 --> 00:36:47,530
It was Aegon.

262
00:36:50,324 --> 00:36:53,369
Me?

263
00:36:53,911 --> 00:36:55,204
And you, boy?

264
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:02,377
Where did you hear
such calumnies?

265
00:37:02,378 --> 00:37:05,172
Aegon!
Tell me the truth of it!

266
00:37:07,717 --> 00:37:10,344
We know, Father.

267
00:37:12,138 --> 00:37:14,181
Everyone knows.

268
00:37:15,683 --> 00:37:17,310
Just look at them.

269
00:37:34,201 --> 00:37:36,537
This interminable
infighting must cease!

270
00:37:36,621 --> 00:37:38,956
All of you!

271
00:37:40,625 --> 00:37:43,419
We are family!

272
00:37:48,132 --> 00:37:52,135
Now make your apologies
and show good will
to one another.

273
00:37:52,136 --> 00:37:55,222
Your father, your grandsire,
your king demands it!

274
00:38:11,364 --> 00:38:12,990
That is insufficient.

275
00:38:15,910 --> 00:38:17,953
Aemond has been damaged,
permanently, My King.

276
00:38:17,954 --> 00:38:19,621
"Good will" cannot
make him whole.

277
00:38:19,622 --> 00:38:21,874
I know, Alicent,

278
00:38:21,958 --> 00:38:23,458
but I cannot restore his eye.

279
00:38:23,459 --> 00:38:25,294
No, because it's been taken.

280
00:38:25,378 --> 00:38:28,881
- What would you have me do?
- There is a debt to be paid.

281
00:38:32,301 --> 00:38:35,304
I shall have one of her
son's eyes in return.

282
00:38:37,765 --> 00:38:41,143
- My dear wife.
- He is your son, Viserys.

283
00:38:41,227 --> 00:38:41,686
Your blood.

284
00:38:41,687 --> 00:38:43,186
Do not...

285
00:38:43,187 --> 00:38:47,483
allow your temper
to guide your judgment.

286
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:56,074
If the King
will not seek justice,
the Queen will.

287
00:38:56,075 --> 00:38:57,243
Ser Criston...

288
00:38:58,744 --> 00:39:00,663
bring me the eye
of Lucerys Velaryon.

289
00:39:01,455 --> 00:39:02,164
- Mother!
- Alicent.

290
00:39:02,248 --> 00:39:03,248
He can choose which eye to keep,

291
00:39:03,249 --> 00:39:04,875
a privilege he did
not grant my son.

292
00:39:04,959 --> 00:39:07,211
You will do no such thing.

293
00:39:07,295 --> 00:39:10,006
- Stay your hand.
- No, you are sworn to me!

294
00:39:14,385 --> 00:39:16,512
As your protector, my Queen.

295
00:39:19,557 --> 00:39:23,685
Alicent, this matter...
is finished.

296
00:39:23,686 --> 00:39:25,354
Do you understand?

297
00:39:37,616 --> 00:39:38,576
And let it be known:

298
00:39:38,577 --> 00:39:41,244
anyone whose tongue dares
to question the birth

299
00:39:41,245 --> 00:39:43,580
of Princess Rhaenyra's sons

300
00:39:43,581 --> 00:39:45,750
should have it removed.

301
00:39:48,627 --> 00:39:51,672
Thank you, Father.

302
00:40:00,931 --> 00:40:02,993
Your Grace.
Stay with the King!
Alicent!

303
00:40:03,017 --> 00:40:04,601
Hold your approach!

304
00:40:04,602 --> 00:40:06,436
- Do not, Ser Criston!
- Alicent!

305
00:40:06,437 --> 00:40:08,188
Do not, Ser Criston!

306
00:40:08,189 --> 00:40:10,148
Alicent!

307
00:40:10,149 --> 00:40:12,275
No!

308
00:40:12,276 --> 00:40:14,278
Stay your hand, Cole!

309
00:40:15,821 --> 00:40:17,280
You've gone too far.

310
00:40:17,281 --> 00:40:18,615
I?

311
00:40:18,616 --> 00:40:20,993
What have I done
but what was expected
of me?

312
00:40:22,244 --> 00:40:25,664
Forever upholding
the kingdom,
the family, the law.

313
00:40:27,333 --> 00:40:30,293
- While you flout all
to do as you please.
- Alicent, let her go!

314
00:40:30,294 --> 00:40:32,963
Where is duty?
Where is sacrifice?

315
00:40:33,047 --> 00:40:34,840
It's trampled under
your pretty foot again.

316
00:40:34,924 --> 00:40:37,009
Release the blade, Alicent.

317
00:40:37,093 --> 00:40:39,302
And now you take my son's eye,

318
00:40:39,303 --> 00:40:40,971
and to even that,
you feel entitled.

319
00:40:41,055 --> 00:40:43,265
Exhausting, wasn't it?

320
00:40:43,349 --> 00:40:46,309
Hiding beneath the cloak
of your own righteousness.

321
00:40:46,310 --> 00:40:50,147
But now they see you as you are.

322
00:41:27,101 --> 00:41:29,978
Do not mourn me, Mother.

323
00:41:29,979 --> 00:41:31,939
It was a fair exchange.

324
00:41:32,648 --> 00:41:35,025
I may have lost an eye...

325
00:41:36,527 --> 00:41:38,362
but I gained a dragon.

326
00:41:46,871 --> 00:41:48,998
This proceeding is at an end.

327
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:28,496
The Hand, Your Grace.

328
00:42:45,763 --> 00:42:47,722
Say your piece.

329
00:42:47,723 --> 00:42:49,892
Now, what piece is that?

330
00:42:52,895 --> 00:42:55,730
I've conducted myself
in a manner...

331
00:42:55,731 --> 00:42:57,900
unbefitting my station.

332
00:42:59,401 --> 00:43:00,736
Or any other.

333
00:43:04,156 --> 00:43:05,741
I lost composure...

334
00:43:07,868 --> 00:43:10,913
assaulted the Princess.

335
00:43:11,705 --> 00:43:15,251
Already the word is spreading,
the gossip speculating
that I've gone mad.

336
00:43:16,085 --> 00:43:18,545
All true.

337
00:43:18,629 --> 00:43:20,256
I disgraced myself.

338
00:43:22,383 --> 00:43:25,928
And ensured
my husband's favor will
forever rest on her.

339
00:43:27,429 --> 00:43:28,889
And yet...

340
00:43:30,015 --> 00:43:32,476
I've never seen that side
of you, my daughter.

341
00:43:35,437 --> 00:43:37,981
I even doubted its existence.

342
00:43:37,982 --> 00:43:41,568
- It was an ugly thing.
I regret it.
- We play an ugly game.

343
00:43:43,445 --> 00:43:44,821
And now, for the first time,

344
00:43:44,822 --> 00:43:48,367
I see that you have
the determination
to win it.

345
00:43:52,162 --> 00:43:55,332
- Rhaenyra...
- You see her for what she is.

346
00:43:55,416 --> 00:43:58,377
What the King's
stubbornness has wrought.

347
00:44:01,588 --> 00:44:05,009
- What will he say to me?
- He'll forgive you.

348
00:44:06,135 --> 00:44:08,512
What else can he do?

349
00:44:09,930 --> 00:44:12,515
Now go to him, be penitent,

350
00:44:12,516 --> 00:44:15,185
plead the injury to your son.

351
00:44:15,269 --> 00:44:18,188
Keep a grip on your passions.

352
00:44:18,272 --> 00:44:22,443
And I promise you,
in time, you and I
together will prevail.

353
00:44:25,612 --> 00:44:27,656
What that rogue Aemond has done

354
00:44:27,740 --> 00:44:30,409
in winning Vhagar to our side.

355
00:44:32,161 --> 00:44:33,787
The boy was right.

356
00:44:33,871 --> 00:44:37,124
It's worth a thousand times
the price he paid.

357
00:45:01,148 --> 00:45:02,274
Mm.

358
00:45:03,484 --> 00:45:07,654
You will scar,
but the wound will heal.

359
00:45:08,947 --> 00:45:11,491
Valyrian steel cuts clean.

360
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:19,833
Gods.

361
00:45:22,127 --> 00:45:23,753
Is everyone all right?

362
00:45:23,754 --> 00:45:25,547
A broken nose is the worst.

363
00:45:25,631 --> 00:45:27,007
Thank you, maester.

364
00:45:27,674 --> 00:45:28,759
Leave us.

365
00:45:32,096 --> 00:45:33,680
You as well.

366
00:45:33,764 --> 00:45:37,517
You've already found
enough trouble today.

367
00:45:37,518 --> 00:45:38,644
Yes, Mother.

368
00:45:46,693 --> 00:45:47,486
I should've been there.

369
00:45:47,487 --> 00:45:50,447
Those should be our house words.

370
00:45:52,533 --> 00:45:56,202
I have fought dreadful enemies,

371
00:45:56,203 --> 00:45:58,872
but I could not defend
my dear sister

372
00:45:58,956 --> 00:46:01,083
far from home and in agony.

373
00:46:02,501 --> 00:46:04,628
- I could not defend you.
- Sit down.

374
00:46:16,348 --> 00:46:18,725
Aemond called our sons bastards.

375
00:46:24,565 --> 00:46:27,234
I have failed you, Rhaenyra.

376
00:46:27,734 --> 00:46:29,986
Our marriage...

377
00:46:29,987 --> 00:46:32,239
I tried.

378
00:46:34,408 --> 00:46:35,701
Our boys...

379
00:46:37,411 --> 00:46:38,995
- I do love them.
- I know.

380
00:46:38,996 --> 00:46:40,497
Deeply.

381
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:46,378
But I have not, mayhaps...

382
00:46:48,005 --> 00:46:49,339
loved them enough.

383
00:46:55,262 --> 00:46:57,723
I had hoped to bear
your children.

384
00:46:59,433 --> 00:47:01,560
The few times we lay together.

385
00:47:05,272 --> 00:47:07,191
Things might've been different.

386
00:47:10,652 --> 00:47:13,864
I hate the gods
for making me as they did.

387
00:47:14,281 --> 00:47:16,449
I do not.

388
00:47:16,450 --> 00:47:18,911
You are an honorable man

389
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:23,164
with a good heart.

390
00:47:23,165 --> 00:47:25,375
It's a rare thing.

391
00:47:30,797 --> 00:47:32,437
We made an arrangement
all those years ago

392
00:47:32,466 --> 00:47:34,801
to do our duty and...

393
00:47:36,970 --> 00:47:38,805
yet explore happiness.

394
00:47:45,979 --> 00:47:48,189
But there are times

395
00:47:48,190 --> 00:47:51,527
I think when these things
cannot mutually exist.

396
00:47:54,488 --> 00:47:58,534
Ser Qarl will return
soon to the fighting
in the Stepstones.

397
00:48:00,285 --> 00:48:02,412
But I recommit myself to you.

398
00:48:03,956 --> 00:48:08,543
And to strengthening
our house as we prepare you
for your ascension.

399
00:48:08,544 --> 00:48:11,796
I will raise our sons
to be princes of the realm.

400
00:48:11,797 --> 00:48:14,424
- Laenor...
- You deserve better
than what I have been.

401
00:48:17,177 --> 00:48:19,012
You deserve a husband.

402
00:48:39,283 --> 00:48:41,284
I've asked them
to have wine ready
for you on the ship.

403
00:48:41,285 --> 00:48:43,453
To help you sleep.

404
00:48:52,045 --> 00:48:53,630
I'm so sorry.

405
00:48:56,466 --> 00:48:57,634
Viserys...

406
00:48:57,718 --> 00:48:58,844
We will speak no more of it.

407
00:50:15,754 --> 00:50:17,881
Fire is such strange power.

408
00:50:22,302 --> 00:50:24,888
Everything that House Targaryen
possesses is owed to it.

409
00:50:27,808 --> 00:50:30,268
Yet it has cost us both
what we loved.

410
00:50:32,020 --> 00:50:33,771
Perhaps the Velaryons
knew the truth of it.

411
00:50:33,772 --> 00:50:34,981
The sea is the better ally.

412
00:50:37,317 --> 00:50:39,402
Fire is a prison.

413
00:50:39,403 --> 00:50:41,905
The sea offers an escape.

414
00:50:51,164 --> 00:50:52,642
A perversion of justice.

415
00:50:52,666 --> 00:50:55,293
The young prince...

416
00:50:55,377 --> 00:50:56,712
defiled.

417
00:50:58,171 --> 00:50:59,423
An outrage.

418
00:51:01,341 --> 00:51:02,759
Indeed.

419
00:51:06,388 --> 00:51:07,180
If it's an eye you want

420
00:51:07,264 --> 00:51:10,809
to balance the scales,
I am your servant.

421
00:51:15,731 --> 00:51:17,774
That will not be necessary.

422
00:51:20,652 --> 00:51:22,252
But your devotion
has not gone unnoticed.

423
00:51:23,697 --> 00:51:26,658
These are dangerous times.

424
00:51:30,370 --> 00:51:34,374
The day will doubtless come
when I require such a friend.

425
00:51:35,876 --> 00:51:39,337
With not only skill
but discretion as well.

426
00:51:42,174 --> 00:51:45,343
I shall await your call,
my Queen.

427
00:52:00,525 --> 00:52:03,361
I need you, Uncle.

428
00:53:05,799 --> 00:53:08,760
We could not marry
unless Laenor were dead.

429
00:53:14,140 --> 00:53:15,433
I know.

430
00:53:28,363 --> 00:53:32,825
I've heard about
your exploits
in the Stepstones,

431
00:53:32,826 --> 00:53:34,869
Ser Qarl.

432
00:53:34,870 --> 00:53:36,829
Said to be a knight
of remarkable skill.

433
00:53:36,830 --> 00:53:39,582
You flatter me, m'lord.

434
00:53:39,583 --> 00:53:42,251
But alas, common-born.

435
00:53:42,252 --> 00:53:45,880
You're a landless knight
with a lord's taste.

436
00:53:45,881 --> 00:53:47,799
Ser Laenor's been kind to me.

437
00:53:49,509 --> 00:53:50,886
Do you know...

438
00:53:53,346 --> 00:53:56,224
there are places across
the Narrow Sea...

439
00:53:56,308 --> 00:54:00,853
where it doesn't matter
what a man's name is?

440
00:54:00,854 --> 00:54:03,607
Only how much gold he possesses.

441
00:54:07,027 --> 00:54:08,347
What are you asking
of me, m'lord?

442
00:54:09,696 --> 00:54:11,323
A quick death.

443
00:54:12,949 --> 00:54:14,576
One with witnesses.

444
00:54:23,460 --> 00:54:26,295
<i>I will not be a tyrant.</i>

445
00:54:26,296 --> 00:54:28,965
And rule through terror.

446
00:54:29,049 --> 00:54:30,842
<i>A tyrant rules
only through terror.</i>

447
00:54:30,926 --> 00:54:33,762
Shh.

448
00:54:37,599 --> 00:54:40,143
<i>If the King isn't feared,
he is powerless.</i>

449
00:54:41,227 --> 00:54:42,455
<i>If you are to be a strong queen,</i>

450
00:54:42,479 --> 00:54:44,313
<i>you must cultivate
love and respect, yes,</i>

451
00:54:44,314 --> 00:54:47,108
<i>but your subjects must fear you.</i>

452
00:54:47,192 --> 00:54:48,818
Who let you in here?

453
00:54:52,405 --> 00:54:54,658
Why are you in my father's hall?

454
00:54:59,663 --> 00:55:01,665
You have always
looked down on me.

455
00:55:02,916 --> 00:55:04,250
<i>I do love Laenor.</i>

456
00:55:04,334 --> 00:55:07,212
<i>Then grant him this kindness.</i>

457
00:55:08,296 --> 00:55:09,505
<i>Set him free.</i>

458
00:55:09,506 --> 00:55:12,634
You forget yourself.

459
00:55:13,259 --> 00:55:15,178
My lord. Please!

460
00:55:21,559 --> 00:55:22,559
I'll alert the guards!

461
00:55:31,778 --> 00:55:35,031
<i>This will cost Lord Corlys
and Princess Rhaenys</i>

462
00:55:35,115 --> 00:55:36,241
<i>their only remaining child.</i>

463
00:55:40,328 --> 00:55:43,373
<i>And the realm will whisper
that I was somehow responsible.</i>

464
00:55:47,252 --> 00:55:48,711
No!

465
00:55:48,712 --> 00:55:49,546
<i>Let them whisper.</i>

466
00:55:49,547 --> 00:55:52,507
No!

467
00:55:54,551 --> 00:55:55,843
How did you let this happen?

468
00:55:55,844 --> 00:55:57,929
In my fucking hall?

469
00:55:58,013 --> 00:55:59,180
Tell me!

470
00:55:59,264 --> 00:55:59,764
<i>We will know the truth of it</i>

471
00:55:59,848 --> 00:56:03,351
<i>and our enemies won't.</i>

472
00:56:03,435 --> 00:56:06,396
They will fear what else
we might be capable of.
