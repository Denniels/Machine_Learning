121
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:27,858

Do you think Daemon is
distracted by his present tasks?

124
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,681
And that his thoughts
and energies are occupied?

125
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:37,952
Well, one would hope so,
considering the associated costs.

126
00:08:37,976 --> 00:08:40,937
Then let us all consider your
gold well-invested, Lord Beesbury.

127
00:08:41,338 --> 00:08:43,206

146
00:09:28,624 --> 00:09:31,088

Landing already. To turn them back now...

147
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:33,215

take the better part of a week.

148
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:35,650
Before the games are over,
my son will be born,

149
00:09:36,059 --> 00:09:37,887
and the whole realm will celebrate.

150
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:39,847

00:11:22,738 --> 00:11:24,438
Like Dark Sister.

185
00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:29,439
Turn around.

186
00:11:44,072 --> 00:11:45,079
Now...

187
00:11:46,379 --> 00:11:49,876
you and I both own a small piece
of our ancestry.

188
00:11:56,647 --> 00:11:59,344
(speaks High Valyrian)

189
00:12:00,234 --> 00:12:01,487
Alicent:
Did you read it?

190
00:12:01,512 --> 00:12:03,014
Rhaenyra:
Of course, I read it.

191
00:12:03,151 --> 00:12:05,618
Alicent: When Princess
Nymeria arrived in Dorne,

192
00:12:05,642 --> 00:12:07,411
who did she take to husband?

193
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:08,461
Rhaenyra:
A man.

194
00:12:08,795 --> 00:12:10,255
Alicent:
What was his name?

195
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:11,981
Rhaenyra:
Lord Something.

196
00:12:12,428 --> 00:12:13,989
Alicent: If you answer
with "Lord Something,"

197
00:12:14,013 --> 00:12:16,002
Septa Marlow will be furious.

198
00:12:16,027 --> 00:12:17,683
She's funny when she's furious.

199
00:12:20,978 --> 00:12:23,242
You're always like this
when you're worried.

200
00:12:23,309 --> 00:12:24,598
Like what?

201
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:26,526
Disagreeable.

202
00:12:30,465 --> 00:12:32,949
You're worried your father
is about to overshadow you

203
00:12:33,032 --> 00:12:34,045
with a son.

204
00:12:34,367 --> 00:12:36,281
I only worry for my mother.

205
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:39,534
I hope for my father that he gets a son.

206
00:12:40,285 --> 00:12:42,679
As long as I can recall,
it's all he's wanted.

207
00:12:43,872 --> 00:12:45,456
You want him to have a son?

208
00:12:45,748 --> 00:12:47,992
I want to fly with you on dragon back,

209
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:50,913
see the great wonders across the
Narrow Sea, and eat only cake.

210
00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:53,339
- I'm being serious.
- I never jest about cake.

211
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,805
You aren't worried about your position?

212
00:12:55,888 --> 00:12:58,094
I like this position.
It's quite comfortable.

213
00:13:02,478 --> 00:13:05,768
- Where are you going?
- Home. The hour has grown late.

214
00:13:06,936 --> 00:13:08,943
Princess Nymeria led her Rhoynar

215
00:13:09,026 --> 00:13:11,195
across the Narrow Sea on 10,000 ships

216
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:13,239
to flee their Valyrian pursuers.

217
00:13:13,322 --> 00:13:16,200
She took Lord Mors Martell
of Dorne to husband

218
00:13:16,321 --> 00:13:18,327
and burned her own fleet off Sun spear

219
00:13:18,411 --> 00:13:20,496
to show her people that
they were finished running.

220
00:13:22,482 --> 00:13:24,704
- What are you doing?
- So you remember.

221
00:13:25,747 --> 00:13:28,666
- If-if the Septa sees this book, then...
- Fuck the Septa.

222
00:13:29,088 --> 00:13:30,506
Alicent:
Rhaenyra!

223
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:32,645
- (both laughing)
- (bell tolling)

224
00:13:37,305 --> 00:13:39,390
(birds cawing)

225
00:13:43,181 --> 00:13:44,390
Is it healing?

226
00:13:44,641 --> 00:13:47,410
Mellos: It has grown
slightly, Your Grace.

227
00:13:49,645 --> 00:13:51,606
Otto High tower:
Can you say yet what it is?

228
00:13:51,778 --> 00:13:54,268
We've sent enquiries to the Citadel.

229
00:13:54,292 --> 00:13:56,437
They are searching
the texts for similar cases.

230
00:13:56,461 --> 00:13:58,939
It's a small cut
from sitting the throne.

231
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:00,073
It's nothing.

232
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:02,952
The King has been under heavy stresses

233
00:14:02,976 --> 00:14:04,535
preparing for the birth.

234
00:14:05,495 --> 00:14:07,330
Bad humors of the mind

235
00:14:07,413 --> 00:14:09,582
can adversely affect the body.

236
00:14:10,166 --> 00:14:13,252
Whatever it is,
it needs to be kept quiet.

237
00:14:16,829 --> 00:14:18,542
We should leech it again, maester.

238
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:21,069
It's a wound that refuses to
heal, Grand Maester.

239
00:14:22,345 --> 00:14:24,263
Might I suggest cauterization?

240
00:14:24,347 --> 00:14:26,120
Cauterization would be a wise

241
00:14:26,144 --> 00:14:27,934
course of treatment, Your Grace.

242
00:14:28,476 --> 00:14:30,317
- It will be painful...
- King Viserys: Fine.

243
00:14:32,105 --> 00:14:33,189
Fine.

244
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:35,316
(seabirds cawing)

245
00:14:39,351 --> 00:14:40,571
(door opens)

246
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:44,409
(door closes)

247
00:14:46,035 --> 00:14:48,705
You spend more time in that bath
than I do on the throne.

248
00:14:49,359 --> 00:14:50,741
(sighs) This is the only place

249
00:14:50,765 --> 00:14:52,959
I can find comfort these days.

250
00:14:55,264 --> 00:14:56,629
It's tepid.

251
00:14:56,948 --> 00:14:59,424
It's as warm as the maesters will allow.

252
00:14:59,674 --> 00:15:02,260
- Don't they know dragons prefer heat?
- Hm.

253
00:15:03,094 --> 00:15:05,388
After this miserable pregnancy...

254
00:15:06,139 --> 00:15:09,350
I wouldn't be surprised if
I hatched an actual dragon.

255
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,811
(laughs) Then he will
be loved and cherished.

256
00:15:12,954 --> 00:15:15,898
Rhaenyra has already declared
that she is to have a sister.

257
00:15:16,232 --> 00:15:17,232
Really?

258
00:15:17,608 --> 00:15:20,570
- She even named her.
- Dare I ask?

259
00:15:21,446 --> 00:15:23,357
- Visenya.
- (chuckles)

260
00:15:23,381 --> 00:15:25,150
She chose a dragon's egg for the cradle

261
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:26,985
that she said reminded her of Vhagar.

262
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:28,278
Gods be good.

263
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:30,747
This family already has its Visenya.

264
00:15:32,857 --> 00:15:35,418
Has there been any word
from your dear brother?

265
00:15:35,626 --> 00:15:38,296
Not since I named him
Commander of the City Watch.

266
00:15:39,047 --> 00:15:41,607
I'm sure he will reemerge
for the tourney.

267
00:15:42,341 --> 00:15:44,510
He could never stay away from the lists.

268
00:15:44,886 --> 00:15:46,095
The tourney...

269
00:15:46,345 --> 00:15:48,090
to celebrate the firstborn son

270
00:15:48,114 --> 00:15:49,866
that we presently do not have.

271
00:15:50,725 --> 00:15:52,185
You do understand

272
00:15:52,435 --> 00:15:54,638
nothing will cause
the babe to grow a cock

273
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:56,564
if it does not already possess one?

274
00:15:56,814 --> 00:15:59,317
- This child is a boy, Aemma.
- (scoffs)

275
00:15:59,525 --> 00:16:00,943
I'm certain of it.

276
00:16:01,652 --> 00:16:04,113
I've never been more
certain of anything.

277
00:16:07,782 --> 00:16:08,826
The dream.

278
00:16:10,232 --> 00:16:11,913
It was clearer than a memory.

279
00:16:14,445 --> 00:16:17,126
Our son was born wearing
Aegon's iron crown.

280
00:16:19,033 --> 00:16:22,298
And I heard the sound
of thundering hooves,

281
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:25,093
splintering shields, and ringing swords,

282
00:16:25,927 --> 00:16:28,613
and I placed our son
upon the Iron Throne...

283
00:16:29,941 --> 00:16:31,949
as the bells of the Grand Sept tolled

284
00:16:32,575 --> 00:16:34,727
and all the dragons roared as one.

285
00:16:38,314 --> 00:16:40,191
Born wearing a crown?

286
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:41,984
Gods spare me...

287
00:16:42,276 --> 00:16:44,529
birth is unpleasant enough as it is.

288
00:16:53,913 --> 00:16:55,706
This is the last time,

289
00:16:56,332 --> 00:16:57,500
Viserys.

290
00:17:00,089 --> 00:17:02,088
I've lost one babe in the cradle,

291
00:17:02,171 --> 00:17:04,173
had two stillbirths, and two pregnancies

292
00:17:04,257 --> 00:17:06,217
ended well before their term.

293
00:17:09,095 --> 00:17:11,973
That's five... in twice as many years.

294
00:17:13,391 --> 00:17:16,102
I know it is my duty
to provide you an heir,

295
00:17:16,477 --> 00:17:19,981
and I'm sorry if I have
failed you in that. I am.

296
00:17:23,693 --> 00:17:26,445
But I've mourned all
the dead children I can.

297
00:17:26,988 --> 00:17:28,072
(somber music playing)

298
00:17:34,328 --> 00:17:36,164

00:17:47,884 --> 00:17:50,178
Captain Randyll Barret:
Commander on the floor!

301
00:17:56,642 --> 00:17:59,912
When I took command of the
Watch, you were stray mongrels...

302
00:18:01,689 --> 00:18:03,900
starving and undisciplined.

303
00:18:05,777 --> 00:18:06,861
Now...

304
00:18:07,184 --> 00:18:09,071
you're a pack of hounds.

305
00:18:09,697 --> 00:18:12,233
You're sated and honed for the hunt.

306
00:18:12,258 --> 00:18:14,285
(all howling)

307
00:18:15,661 --> 00:18:18,831
My brother's city
has fallen into squalor.

308
00:18:20,082 --> 00:18:23,519
Crime of every breed
has been allowed to thrive.

309
00:18:25,546 --> 00:18:26,814
No longer.

310
00:18:27,215 --> 00:18:29,251
Beginning tonight,
King's Landing will learn

311

Your brother made a public show of it,

Did they?

Wouldn't you agree, Lord Strong?

353

- Making a public spectacle of wanton brutality

354

but much of King's Landing
is seen by the small folk

361
00:21:33,876 --> 00:21:36,629
as lawless and terrifying.

362
00:21:38,781 --> 00:21:41,133
Our city should be safe
for all its people.

363
00:21:41,784 --> 00:21:42,952
I agree.

364
00:21:43,577 --> 00:21:45,113
I just hope you don't have to maim

365
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:47,139
half of my city to achieve this.

366
00:21:47,848 --> 00:21:49,225
Time will tell.

367
00:21:51,752 --> 00:21:55,481
We installed Prince Daemon as
commander to promote law and order.

368
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,342
The criminal element
should fear the City Watch.

369
00:21:58,425 --> 00:22:00,025
Thank you for your support, Lord Corlys.

370
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:02,054
If only the Prince would
show the same devotion

371
00:22:02,137 --> 00:22:04,848
to his lady wife as he does his
work, Your Grace.

372
00:22:04,932 --> 00:22:06,433
You've not been seen in the Vale

373
00:22:06,517 --> 00:22:08,686
or at Runestone for quite some time.

374
00:22:08,769 --> 00:22:11,222
I think my bronze bitch
is happier for my absence.

375
00:22:11,247 --> 00:22:13,024
Otto:
Lady Rhea is your wife,

376
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:15,192
a good and honorable lady of the Vale.

377
00:22:15,275 --> 00:22:17,994
In the Vale, men are said to
fuck sheep instead of women.

378
00:22:18,128 --> 00:22:20,572
I can assure you,
the sheep are prettier.

379
00:22:20,656 --> 00:22:21,656
Dear me.

380
00:22:21,699 --> 00:22:22,992
You made a vow before the Seven

381
00:22:23,075 --> 00:22:24,777
to honor your wife in marriage.

382
00:22:24,802 --> 00:22:26,304
Well, I'd gladly give Lady Rhea to you,

383
00:22:26,328 --> 00:22:27,871
Lord High tower, if you're in want

384
00:22:27,955 --> 00:22:30,082
of a woman to warm your bed.

385
00:22:30,165 --> 00:22:32,641
Your own lady wife passed recently.

386
00:22:35,003 --> 00:22:36,272
Did she not?

387
00:22:36,797 --> 00:22:37,840
Otto.

388
00:22:41,093 --> 00:22:43,470
Perhaps you aren't ready
to move on just yet.

389
00:22:44,305 --> 00:22:47,141
You know how my brother
makes sport of provoking you.

390
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:49,393
Must you indulge him?

391
00:22:53,397 --> 00:22:55,381
My apologies, Your Grace.

392
00:22:55,541 --> 00:22:58,610
King Viserys: This council
has, at great expense,

393
00:22:58,694 --> 00:23:01,547
bettered the City Watch
to your exacting standards.

394
00:23:01,739 --> 00:23:04,158
Enforce my laws, but understand...

395
00:23:04,617 --> 00:23:07,161
any further performances
like last night's

396
00:23:07,244 --> 00:23:08,328
will be answered.

397
00:23:12,291 --> 00:23:13,626
Understood, Your Grace.

398
00:23:27,531 --> 00:23:30,066
King's Landing has been in decline

son of Lord Dondarrion's steward.

468

celebrate the birth of our future king.

531
00:32:46,622 --> 00:32:49,068
- Hm.
- With wanton violence.

532
00:32:49,092 --> 00:32:51,404
Princess Rhaenys: It's been 70
years since King Maegor's end.

533
00:32:51,428 --> 00:32:53,229
These knights are as green
as summer grass.

534

None have known real war.

535
00:32:55,891 --> 00:32:57,842
Their lords sent them
to the tourney field

536
00:32:57,925 --> 00:33:00,621
with fists full of steel
and balls full of seed,

537
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:03,023
and we expect them to act
with honor and grace.

538
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:05,901
It's a marvel that war didn't

If order and stability
so concerns this council,

716

then perhaps we shouldn't break 100
years of it by naming a girl heir.

717

Daemon would be a second Maegor,
or worse.

He is impulsive and violent.

719

to, Your Grace.

727
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:03,422
(laughs) Such as your wife, Lord Corlys?

728

- Rhaenys was the only child

729

of Jaehaerys' eldest son.

730

at the Great Council,

731
00:47:09,076 --> 00:47:10,929

732
